- Final paper was accepted to the SIGMOD 2020 conference
- Employed hierarchical clustering during the pre-indexing phase of a database to generate a dendrogram.  Interrogated this dendrogram with a UCB algorithm to accelerate Select Limit queries that have a user defined function as the predicate.

### Competitions / School


[A Neural Twist on Natural Questions](https://github.com/maxstrome/brainNQ)

<img src="images/bert.png?raw=true"/>

- Compared three different models on subset Natural Questions problem
- Analyzed "intelligence" displayed by these models
- Final model adds a Restricted Boltzmann Machine at the end of BERT for dimensionality reduction, leading to improved results

[RIIID Knowledge Tracing Kaggle Competition Submission](https://github.com/maxstrome/RIIIDFinal/tree/main)

- Implemented increasingly intelligent models to learn about the knowledge tracing problem, the data, and get better results
- Final model was ensemble between a light gradient boosting machine and a deep neural network
